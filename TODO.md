Current things to do:

* finish namespaces of imports
* POD and other documentation
* versioning with imports and serving?
    - like, import between versions x and y
    - versions are stored in directories
    - the HEAD symlinks to the one to be used
* internal content tutorial
* write full description of state
* integration with RPC like yote
* get working on madyote
* add tests

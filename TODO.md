Current things to do:

* integration with RPC like yote

* better name for internal content?

* POD and other documentation

* more automated tests

* versioning with imports and serving?
    - like, import between versions x and y
    - versions are stored in directories
    - the HEAD symlinks to the one to be used

* write full description of state
* get working on madyote
* add tests

The idea bin

* imports with functions?
    no for now, the functions can be included in the components

Current things to do:

BUGS:
  * refresh not removing old stuff?

* more explanations in gotchas
  - weed out semicolons at the end of '() => something;'
  - better error messages
  - bind functions to components

* dynamically add a component
  - start with an example of this and add to it
  - shape it into the syntax desired
  - make sure it works
  - oh, can o worms with stats - if they have variables ...
    - no more global than page/package/file globals?
  - this couldprobably be all done using looping however

* integration with RPC like yote

* better name for internal content?

* POD and other documentation

* more automated tests

* ~~versioning with imports and serving?~~
  - **not gonna**
  - ~~like, import between versions x and y~~
  - ~~versions are stored in directories~~
  - ~~the HEAD symlinks to the one to be used~~

* write full description of state

* get working on madyote

* add tests

The idea bin

* imports with functions?
    no for now, the functions can be included in the components

Spiderpup allows you to build reactive websites using yaml to describe recipes and modules built from javascript, less/css and html elements. It maps urls to yaml files that it uses to serve pages. 

# ---- data transition -------

Designer Input. The YAML files.

The YAML files have the following top level keywords:

 # page definition
 * page with fields 'body' and 'title'
 * preLoad: called when namespace is loaded
 * onLoad: called when namespace is rendered

 # html header stuff (only used if body is given)
 * include
   - css : single or list of css files to include
   - javascript : single or list of css files to include
   - javascript-module : single or list of css files to include
 * title : string title
 * javascript : string javascript to include
 * css : string css to include
 * less : string less that will be translated into css to include

 # namespace things
 * import_namespace: alias -> YAML filename
 * recipes: name -> component recipe node
 * data: name  -> function or value
 * functions: name -> function
 * listen: function called to listen to a general broadcast

 # component recipe nodes
 * contents: list of element or component instance nodes
             must include exactly one element which will either
             be a component instance or element node
 * data: name  -> function or value
 * functions: name -> function
 * class: class(es) to add to root element node of the recipe
 * preLoad: called when namespace is loaded


 # component (recipe) instance nodes
 * contents: list of element or component instance nodes
             that are in the scope of the instance that
             creates the component and are placed
             within the component's root element.
 * fill_contents: <fill name> -> 
             list of element or component instance nodes
             that are in the scope of the instance that
             creates the component and are placed
             within the component in named fill spots
 * data: name -> function or value (for overrides)
 * functions: name -> function (for overrides)
 * class: class(es) to add to root element node of the recipe
 * if/elseif: function expecting a boolean return
 * else: a true value
 * forvar: a string name for the iterator
 * foreach: a function that returns a list to iterate over (TODO: should be iterator?)
 * on_<eventname>: a function that handles events emitted by the instance

 # element nodes
 * contents: list of element or component instance nodes
             that are in the scope of the instance that
             creates the component and are placed
             within the component in fill spots
             or it root element.
 * fill: <true or fill name> -> 
             this element is a container for filling content (if true) or fill_content (if named)
             for component instance elements
 * class: class(es) to add to this element
 * if/elseif: function expecting a boolean return
 * else: a true value
 * forvar: a string name for the iterator
 * foreach: a function that returns a list to iterate over (TODO: should be iterator?)
 * on_<eventname>: a function that handles events emitted by the element
 * textContent/innerHTML: value or function that is used to attach either to element
 * <any thing else is an attirute name>: value or function that is used to set the attribute named

This example shows a simple reactive spiderpup page that
contains two independent counters. 

style: >-
  .counter {
    border: solid 3px brown;
    margin: 12px;
    padding: 5px;
    span {
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
  }

recipes:
  counter:
    data:
      clicks: 0
      title: no title set
    functions:
      # the counter component is always the first argument sent to functions
      inc: c => c.set( 'clicks', 1 + c.get( 'clicks' ) )
      dec: c => c.set( 'clicks', c.get( 'clicks' ) -1 )
    contents:
      - div:
          class: counter
          contents:
            - h2: c => c.get( 'title' )
            - div:
                - button:
                    textContent: '<'
                    on_click: c => c.fun.dec()
                # the span below adjusts reactively as the clicks count updates
                - span: c => `${c.get('clicks')} clicks`
                - button:
                    textContent: '>'
                    on_click: c => c.fun.inc()

# the top level functions are for the body element
functions:
  greetings: (body,ev) => alert( `hello there` )

# the body is a special component.
body:
  - h1: Hello Spiderpup
  - counter:
      # data specified here overrides the default data 
      # of the component
      data:
        title: counter 1
  - counter:
      data:
        clicks: 12
  - button:
      type: button
      on_click: body => body.fun.greetings()
      textContent: click me

Recipes contain html elements (and other recipes), defined functions and stateful variables. Think of them like classes which have instances place on the page. Recipes can talk to each other by listening to and broadcasting messages.







A walkthru of what happens with spider pup 


 javascript

  things start happening on window.onload

  look at the defaultNamespace in filespaces with the default (current) filename

  look at html head

    set title if given
       
    include explicit css in defaultNamespace.css

    includde css files in defaultNamespace.html.head.css

    includde js files in defaultNamespace.html.head.js

  compile recipies defined in defaultNamespace.recipes

  compile defaultNamespace.html.body

    it is special and is modified a bit before compiled as a recipe
    its contents are adjusted so 'body' is its root recipe node

  when compiling a recipe:

     note: a recipe is a data structure that is used as a blueprint for building recipe instances
      * assigns an id to each recipe node
      * inserts a namespace to each recipe node
          this maps assigned import handles to their namespacje
          <handle>: <filename>   then map the handle to the filespace
      * prepares functions. a function starts out as functionname -> function index
        this looks up the function at the index and assigns functionname -> function

      * check to make sure the recipe has exactly one root node in its contents

      * compiles the content nodes of the recipe
         a node corresponds to an html tag or other recipe to be embedded
          - check for cirucluar recipe references and throw an error if those are encountered
          - if the node is for a recipe to be embeeded, rewrite the node
               - attach functions defined locally for this node
               - attach this node's recipe (not the recipe that it is embedded in)
               - attach args, which is a copy of the original node. it may have data or functions
                 that override the recipe data or function
          - prepare functions as above. html tags may have event handler functions and conditionals and foreach
          - assign id to the node
          - attach the recipe that this node is embeeded in
          - make sure conditionals are sane. it - ie the first node cannot have 'elseif'

      * assigns rootTag to the recipe
         
  create a state for the page (the default namespace)

  when creating a state:
     * it gets a recipe, an optional parent state, and an instance args object
     * it builds a data object, from the data field in recipe and instance args.
         - the instance args override the recipe data values.
         - the data values are converted into numbers, strings or are the results of running functions
     * the state object is created with the following fields
         - parent (can be undefined)
         - fun (function name -> function) 
         - calc (html tag attribute name to function
         - comp (handle assigned to child component --> that component)
         - el (handle assigned to html element --> that element)
         - idx (foreach iterator name -> index for that foreach iterator)
         - it (foreach iterator name -> current foreach iterator value)
         - lastcount (foreach iterator last rendered number of items in its list)
         - recipe
         - data object, which has ~public~ 'get' and 'set' functions and a ~private~ '_check'
           function that returns true if 'set' was used to change a value since the last time
           _check was called (or since the state was created)
         - refresh function that is automatically called and refreshes the component instance

  instantiate the body

  when instantiating a recipe: (recipe instantiation function)
     * instantiation function takes the recipe, instantiation args and a parent state
     * builds a new state with those args
     * creates a new instance
         - has an id
         - has those instantiation args
         - has recipe
         - has the new state

    * calls preLoad on the instance

    * instantiates the contents of the recipe (recipe component instantiation function)
       - starts with its root element
       - each gets a node
       - for a node that is a component, the node is created with the recipe instantiation function
       - for a node that is an html element, node object created
           - id assigned
           - state assigned as the state of the recipe instance
           - empty args
           - contents of this node are instantiated using the recipe component instantiation function
      
    * instantiates the contents

    * attachs the recipe instance handle to the parent state of this instance

  hang the new body instance on the html body element

  when hanging an instance:
    hanging function takes instance and element it is being hung on
      * element textContent and attributes are set using instance args calculate
           or instance.recipe calculate or instance calculate

      * loop through any child elements of the target element
          to make a hash of element key -> element

      * loop through the child nodes of the current node
          - calculate a key for the element that is the equals instance id
             = if the node has foreach, a '_0' suffix is attached to the key
          - check if the key has an element associated with it in the element key hash
          - if not:
            - create html element
            - add to element key hash
            - element starts out hidden
            - if instance node has a handle, then to state.el[handle] -> child element
            - event handlers are attached 
            - key is attached

      * checks to see if each child node should be visible or not based on conditionals

      * for foreach, there is always an element with a key ending in _0
          - foreach calculates a list
          - the suffix number corresponds to the index of the list item assigned to
             the element
          - if the list has fewer elements than the last time it was calculated,
              remove extraneous html elements from document
          - make sure 
     
     

TODO
  * onLoad -> postLoad
  * defaultFilename et al --> rename to be currentFilename
  * component having their own events that can be handled by their enclosing component
  * finish foreach for recipe component instantces
  * decide on replacing or intermingling state with a recipe instance
  * javascript tests

about:
  This shows where a defined component places any contents given to it.
  The 'with-specified-internal' component has a span inside of it
  with the 'internalContent' property. Any contents given to the
  component are placed within that span. The 'no-specified-internal'
  component does not have a child with 'internalContent' so any
  content given to it is placed at the end.

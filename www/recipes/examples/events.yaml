data:
  count: 0

body:
  - h1: Hello Events
  - button:
      textContent: s => 'clicked ' + s.data.count + ' times'
      on_click: s => s.data.count++
        
about: >
  This short example shows a button who's text displays how many times
  it was clicked.
  
  There is no component here; the body also gets a state object
  associated with it.
  
  Whenever an event function is run and if there is a change to its
  data, the page contents are recalculated.

  Notice that the first argument to an event handler is always the
  state, followed by the event object.

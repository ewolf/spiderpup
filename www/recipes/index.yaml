# PROJECT SPIDERPUP : Build web pages and web apps using yaml and css.
#
# OVERVIEW
#
#  This YAML file provides a description of how a web page is to be filled.
#  The server translates this file into javascript data structures. A javascript
#  routine reads in those data structures and attaches html elements to the body
#  of a page. It also attaches event handlers to those elements as specified in the
#  YAML file to make a reactive page.
#
# PROCESS : What the server does when a request is made.
#
#   When requests are made to index.html the server outputs a skeleton page
#   containing an empty body.
#   The page's head contains two references to javascript :
#      * /_/index - returns two data structures that represent this YAML
#      * /js/spiderpup.js - the machinery that converst the data structures to
#                      html elements and populates the body
#
#   The page's head also contains a link to /css/index.css which is a normal css
#   file.
#
# REACTIVE PAGES: HTML elements are automatically updated on state changes.
#
#   Pages are built from modules called 'components' which are instructions on
#   how to build html elements.
#
#   Components may contain other components and must have exactly one root element.
#
#   Each instance of a component gets its own state. A state object is associated
#   with that instance. The state variable of the enclosing component is stored in
#   the 'parent' field of the component instance's state.
#
#   Element attributes may be calculated. Those calculation functions are given
#   the state variable as their first argument.
#
#   Handlers are attached to the html elements. Handler functions' first argument
#   is always the state object of the instance.
#
#   Each time a handler is called, changes in state are detected. If the state
#   has changed, the instance of the component is updated as needed.
#
# BRANCHING AND LOOPS: if/elsif/else and foreach
#
#   an element (like div,span) or a component reference (like myapp) 
#   may have 'if'/'elseif' functions that take
#   the state as an argument and expect a true value to indicate that branch
#   be included or not. After an if or elseif, an 'else' may be evaluated if its
#   precednents returned false.
#
#   an element or component reference with a 'foreach' and a 'forval'. foreach 
#   is a function that returns an array. forval is a variable name. spiderpup will
#   add that element or component for each item in the list while placing the list
#   item value in the state at state.it[forval value] and the iteration index at
#   state.idx[forval value] while it builds that element.
#

    title: spiderpup example page

    - myapp:
    - myapp:
        # this overrides the default data in the component
        # recipe
        data:
          red: 10
          toggled: true
          title: Hello there, I'm a new instance
    - myapp:
        # default functions may be overridden in this
        # instance of the coponent
        functions:
          flip: >
            s => {
              alert( 'flip override' );
              const bb = s.el.buttonBox;
              bb.appendChild( bb.children[0] );

components:
  myapp:

    # each instance of myapp has its own seperate state which is
    # passed to functions as the first argument 's' for state.
    # This is even the first argument for event handlers.
    # The state object has the following fields:
    #    data - an object with get( key ) and set( key, value )
    #    fun - hash of name -> function
    #    el - hash of label -> html element
    #    parent - state of enclosing parent element, if any

    # default data for an instance of myapp. can be acccessed thru
    # the state (s) variable like so.
    #     s.data.get( 'title' )
    #     s.data.set( 'title', 'new title' )
    # changing data in this way causes the app to be refreshed after
    # the function it was run from completes.
    # the initial state data may be overridden in instances of myapp
